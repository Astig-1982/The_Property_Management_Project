* A clear explanation of what every service is providing in detail, so that the client can easily find all the info on the webiste, without the need of callling the company for additional info.
* A clear explanation of how the prices are calculated, so that the client will have a better understanding of the total upon purchasing.
* A personalised profile where the client can add her/his properties, so that she/he can have the total cost of the each service in a quick manner, without having to enter the property details all the time when selecting a service.
